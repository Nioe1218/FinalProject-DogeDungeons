In doing this project fit, at first I looked for a lot of art assets, first built the basic operation of the player so that it can move, and then made two enemies, one is flying in the air melee enemies, one ranged enemies. Then I added weapons and damage system to the player. In the production of the weapon system suitable for the design of the normal attack and power attack two kinds of attack mode, choose a powerful power attack will have a period of time can not attack  to bring the player to choose the way to attack. Then through these art assets to build different room maps, made a randomly generated map system. Finally, the UI and menus were added.
